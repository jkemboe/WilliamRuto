                <p>
                We are in a battle for the soul of Kenya.
It’s time to remember who we are. We’re Kenyans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.
We are the Kenyans. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.
